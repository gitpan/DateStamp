Revision history for DateStamp

1.0.4 Thu Apr  6 12:34:15 CDT 2006 
      Changed a "like" statement in the test case. No changes to actual
      code, though.

1.0.3 Fri Jan 13 16:55:15 CST 2006 
      Ah, a new year. A new month. A slew of bugs revealed. Fixed some
      problems with how the month/day/year was being looked up. No
      changes to any of the interface methods.


1.0.2  Tue Nov 29 19:23:49 CST 2005
       Fixed %day_alpha error. Renamed entire release from
       "DateTime::Current" to "DateStamp" because of namespace
       conflicts. !!! NOTE !!! If--for any reason--you have version
       1.0.0/1.0.1 of DateTime::Current, please delete it and replace with
       current version of DateStamp.
